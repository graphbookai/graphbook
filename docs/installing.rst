Installing
*****************
We are currently working on docker containers and binaries, so that users can quickly get started. But for now, to install Graphbook from source:

#. Clone the repository and cd into the root of the repo

#. Install the web frontend

   .. code-block:: bash
        
        make web

#. Optionally, create and activate your venv

#. Install the requirements

   .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -r requirements.txt
