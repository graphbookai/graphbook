    All of the guides in this section are meant to help you get started with building ML workflows in Graphbook.
    The resulting workflows and custom nodes can be found in :ref:`examples`.

Introduction
============

Keep in mind that when working with Graphbook, the development cycle in building a workflow can be illustrated in a few simple steps:

#. **Build in Python**

    Write processing nodes using Python in your favorite code editor

#. **Assemble in Graphbook**

    Assemble an ML workflow in our graph-based editor with your own processing nodes

#. **Execute**

    Run, monitor, and adjust parameters in your workflow
