# Simple Workflow

Welcome to your first Graphbook workflow!
This one demonstrates the fundamentals of workflows.
Also, make sure to read documentation for each node under "Included Nodes" below.

## Steps

Steps are the functional units of Graphbook workflows.
The two steps included in this workflow are **MyFirstSource** and **MyFirstStep**.

## Resources

Resources are simply objects that can be passed as parameters to Steps or other Resources.
The **Number** resource is an example of a resource.
This is a built-in resource in Graphbook, so you didn't have to code it yourself.
In this workflow, we use it to feed a probability to **MyFirstStep**.
