This is a sample workflow that just generates some fake data and applies some transforms.
If this is your first time using Graphbook, you are encouraged to run and monitor the workflow.
Also, make sure to check out the following links:

* [Repo](https://github.com/graphbookai/graphbook) 
* [Docs](https://docs.graphbook.ai/)
* [Examples](https://github.com/graphbookai/graphbook-examples)

*Hint*: Graphbook created these sample files when it created its workflow directories. You can disable the generation of these files with `--no_sample`.
